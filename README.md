# react-motion-PIN-validator
Trying out react-motion with an interface for validating PINs

`npm up`

`webpack`

`open dist/index.html`

Try some wrong PINs to see the error states.

Correct PIN is 1234

##TODO:
* status text under pin numbers
* spinners during check
* hover / down states for keyboard buttons
* lockout after too many failed attempts
* success transition
